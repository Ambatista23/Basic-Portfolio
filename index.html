                        <p> To whom this may concern,
                            
                            You must be interested in who I am since you have so curiously wandered on my portfolio. 

                            To being with, My name is Andre Moraes Batista. I am natural born citizen of the United States of America, although I do have dual citizenship with Brazil as well. I have just recently graduated this past Fall semester from the Florida State University with a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Criminology.
                            I have high hopes of completing this course with flying colors and combining my two forms of education to pursue a career in Cyber Forensics and Cyber Crimes.
                            I am a triplet, the youngest of 4 siblings. Apparently I have a really generic face, because people say I look like everyone. The list ranges from, most commonly, Daniel Radcliffe to, an insult to my existence, Chicken Little.
                            I participated in a cross-country cycling journey through the duration of a summer to raise money and awareness to people with disabilities, and I continue to make philanthropies a essential part of my life.
